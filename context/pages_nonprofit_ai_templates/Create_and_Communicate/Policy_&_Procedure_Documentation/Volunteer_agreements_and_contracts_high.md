6. Ensure the document balances legal protection with a welcoming, mission-focused tone.

</OUTPUT>

<CONSTRAINTS>
**Dos:**
1. Use clear, accessible language that avoids unnecessary legal jargon while maintaining legal validity
2. Include specific details about volunteer roles, responsibilities, and time commitments
3. Clearly outline what support, training, and resources the organization will provide
4. Address risk management appropriate to the volunteer activities (higher risk = more detailed protections)
5. Incorporate the organization's mission and values to reinforce purpose
6. Include appropriate confidentiality and data protection clauses
7. Specify term length and renewal/termination processes
8. Provide contact information for questions or concerns
9. Make the document welcoming despite its legal nature

**Don'ts:**
1. Don't use language that suggests an employment relationship (avoid terms like "compensation," "wages," "hire/fire")
2. Don't include overly restrictive clauses that could discourage volunteer participation
3. Don't create unnecessarily long documents that overwhelm volunteers
4. Don't include provisions that wouldn't be legally enforceable in your jurisdiction
5. Don't use one-size-fits-all language for significantly different volunteer roles
6. Don't omit important protections for vulnerable populations if relevant to your work
7. Don't use punitive language that creates an adversarial relationship
8. Don't include clauses that contradict your organization's values or mission
</CONSTRAINTS>

<CONTEXT>
Volunteer agreements serve multiple purposes in nonprofit organizations:

1. **Legal Protection**: They establish clear boundaries and protect both the organization and volunteer from liability issues.

2. **Expectation Setting**: They ensure volunteers understand their responsibilities, time commitments, and the support they'll receive.

3. **Risk Management**: They address potential issues before they arise, particularly for roles involving vulnerable populations, confidential information, or safety concerns.

4. **Volunteer Retention**: Well-crafted agreements that balance protection with mission focus help create positive volunteer experiences.

5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Many jurisdictions have specific requirements for volunteer documentation, particularly in healthcare, education, or social services.

The complexity of volunteer agreements should scale with:
- Risk level of volunteer activities
- Access to sensitive information or vulnerable populations
- Specialized skills or certifications required
- Duration and depth of volunteer commitment
- Regulatory requirements in your field and location

<RECAP>
To create an effective volunteer agreement for your nonprofit:

1. **Customize thoroughly**: Replace all placeholder variables with your organization's specific information, particularly [ORGANIZATION_NAME], [VOLUNTEER_ROLE], and details about responsibilities, time commitments, and training.

2. **Scale appropriately**: Adjust the complexity based on risk level - simple agreements for low-risk roles, comprehensive contracts for roles involving vulnerable populations, confidential information, or specialized skills.

3. **Balance protection with welcome**: Ensure the document protects your organization while still reflecting your mission and creating a positive volunteer experience.

4. **Consider jurisdiction**: Have agreements reviewed by legal counsel familiar with nonprofit law in your location, especially regarding liability waivers and mandatory reporting requirements.

5. **Implementation matters**: Create a consistent process for reviewing agreements with volunteers, answering questions, obtaining signatures, and securely storing documents.

6. **Regular review**: Update your volunteer agreements annually to reflect changes in programs, policies, or legal requirements.

Remember that the best volunteer agreements clearly communicate expectations, provide appropriate protections, and reinforce the meaningful contribution volunteers make to your mission.
