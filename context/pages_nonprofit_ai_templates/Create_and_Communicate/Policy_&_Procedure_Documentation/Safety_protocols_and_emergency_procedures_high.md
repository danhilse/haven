   - Include both prevention and response components for each hazard
   - Consider limited resources and staffing typical of nonprofit organizations

2. Don'ts:
   - Don't use overly technical language that would confuse non-specialists
   - Don't create procedures that require expensive equipment the organization likely doesn't have
   - Don't assume full staffing or professional security/safety personnel
   - Don't ignore the unique aspects of nonprofit operations (volunteers, public access, etc.)
   - Don't create overly complex procedures that won't be followed in an actual emergency
   - Don't include personally identifiable information in templates (use role titles instead of names)
   - Don't copy commercial protocols without adapting to nonprofit context
   - Don't create documentation that conflicts with insurance requirements or increases liability
   - Don't neglect psychological safety and trauma-informed approaches
</CONSTRAINTS>

<CONTEXT>
Nonprofit organizations face unique safety and emergency planning challenges:

1. RESOURCE LIMITATIONS:
   - Limited budgets for safety equipment and training
   - Fewer staff with specific safety responsibilities
   - Reliance on volunteers with varying levels of training
   - Often operating in older or multi-purpose facilities

2. STAKEHOLDER DIVERSITY:
   - Vulnerable populations served (children, elderly, disabled, etc.)
   - High turnover of volunteers and staff
   - Multiple languages and literacy levels
   - Various stakeholders (clients, donors, community members) on premises

3. REGULATORY LANDSCAPE:
   - Varying requirements based on services provided
   - Additional requirements for organizations serving vulnerable populations
   - Grant and funding compliance considerations
   - Insurance requirements and liability concerns

4. FACILITY CONSIDERATIONS:
   - Often in shared, leased, or donated spaces
   - Limited control over building infrastructure
   - Multiple locations with different characteristics
   - Community-based programming in various settings

5. MISSION CONTINUITY:
   - Critical services that cannot be easily suspended
   - Limited redundancy in staffing and systems
   - Community reliance on services during emergencies
   - Donor and funding implications of disruptions
</CONTEXT>

<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
Example #1: Community Food Bank

Input:
We need safety protocols for our food bank that operates in a converted warehouse. We have 5 full-time staff, 50 regular volunteers, and serve about 200 families weekly. We store food, have a client-choice shopping area, and use a loading dock for deliveries. We're located in a flood-prone area of Texas.

Thoughts:
This organization has specific risks related to:
- Food safety and storage
- Volunteer management during emergencies
- Client safety during distribution
- Loading dock and warehouse hazards
- Flooding risk
- Heat emergencies (Texas location)
I'll need to address these specific concerns while creating a comprehensive protocol.

Output excerpt (Fire Emergency section only):

## FIRE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### Prevention Measures
- Ensure electrical equipment is inspected annually
- Maintain clear pathways to all exits at all times
- Store flammable cleaning supplies in approved cabinets
- Prohibit space heaters in the facility
- Conduct monthly fire extinguisher inspections (Safety Coordinator)

### Warning Signs/Detection
- Smoke detectors throughout facility
- Manual pull stations at exits
- Staff/volunteer reports of smoke or burning smells

### Immediate Response Steps
1. If you discover a fire, sound the alarm by pulling the nearest fire alarm station
2. Call 911 immediately
3. If the fire is small and contained (e.g., trash can), a trained staff member may attempt to use a fire extinguisher using the PASS technique (Pull, Aim, Squeeze, Sweep)
4. Begin evacuation procedures immediately
5. Do NOT attempt to save food inventory or equipment

### Evacuation Procedures
1. All staff, volunteers, and clients must exit through the nearest emergency exit
2. Designated floor wardens (identified by orange vests) will:
   - Direct traffic to nearest exits
   - Check bathrooms and break areas
   - Assist individuals with mobility challenges
   - Bring visitor log to assembly point
3. Proceed to the designated assembly area (north parking lot by the large oak tree)
4. Remain at least 100 feet from the building
5. Do not re-enter until authorized by fire department

### Special Considerations for Clients
- Volunteers should be assigned to assist elderly or disabled clients
- Children must remain with parents/guardians
- If client evacuation will be delayed due to mobility issues, notify the fire department immediately upon their arrival

### Staff/Volunteer Responsibilities
- Executive Director: Liaison with fire department, authorize re-entry
- Program Manager: Account for all staff and volunteers using sign-in sheets
- Volunteer Coordinator: Account for all clients in the building
- Warehouse Manager: Shut off utilities if safe to do so
- All Other Staff/Volunteers: Assist with evacuation, then report to assembly area

Example #2: Youth Mentoring Program

Input:
We run an after-school mentoring program for at-risk youth ages 10-18. We operate in three locations: our main office, a community center, and a local high school. We have 8 staff members and 35 volunteer mentors who work one-on-one with youth. We need comprehensive safety protocols, especially for situations involving potential violence or medical emergencies with the youth.

Thoughts:
This organization has specific risks related to:
- Youth safety and supervision
- Multiple locations with different characteristics
- Potential behavioral incidents
- Mandatory reporting requirements
- Transportation between locations
- Medical emergencies involving minors
I'll need to address these while ensuring protocols work across all three locations.

Output excerpt (Medical Emergency section only):

## MEDICAL EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### Prevention Measures
- Collect medical information forms for all youth participants
- Maintain updated emergency contact information for all youth
- Require CPR/First Aid certification for at least one staff member at each location

### Warning Signs/Detection
- Youth reporting feeling unwell
- Observable symptoms (difficulty breathing, loss of consciousness, etc.)
- Injuries from falls or other accidents
- Allergic reactions

### Immediate Response Steps
1. Assess the situation - determine if emergency services are needed
2. If life-threatening:
   - Call 911 immediately
   - Send someone to meet emergency responders at entrance
   - Begin first aid/CPR if trained and necessary
3. If non-life-threatening:
   - Administer appropriate first aid
   - Contact the youth's emergency contact
   - Document the incident

### Special Considerations for Youth Participants
- Never leave an ill or injured youth unattended
- Maintain privacy and dignity during treatment
- Do not administer any medication unless specifically authorized in writing
- For youth with known medical conditions, follow their individual care plan

### Staff/Volunteer Responsibilities

- Site Coordinator: Coordinate response, direct other youth away from the area
- Designated First Aid Responder: Provide immediate care until EMS arrives
- Other Staff/Volunteers: Supervise other youth, assist as directed

### Documentation Requirements
- Complete Incident Report Form within 24 hours
- Document:
  * Youth's name and contact information
  * Date, time, and location of incident
  * Description of the medical emergency
  * Actions taken by staff/volunteers
  * When and who was notified
  * Follow-up actions required
