```
Act as a nonprofit data storyteller who transforms survey results into compelling narratives. Analyze my [SURVEY_DATA] from [PROGRAM_NAME] and create a concise summary that highlights 3-5 key insights, explains their significance to our mission, and suggests 2-3 actionable recommendations tailored for [TARGET_AUDIENCE] (e.g., board members, donors, program participants). Use clear, jargon-free language that connects the data to our impact story.
