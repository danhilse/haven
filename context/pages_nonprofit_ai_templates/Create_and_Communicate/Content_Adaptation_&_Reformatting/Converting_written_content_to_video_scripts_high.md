   - Emotional hooks and storytelling elements
   - Unique value proposition of the program/service/campaign

2. Structure the video script using this framework:
   - Hook (5-10 seconds): Capture attention immediately
   - Introduction (10-15 seconds): Establish the problem/need
   - Main content (60-90 seconds): Present key points with visual descriptions
   - Call-to-action (15-20 seconds): Clear next steps for viewers
   - Closing (5-10 seconds): Reinforce mission impact

3. Transform the content by:
   - Converting paragraphs into concise spoken dialogue
   - Adding visual direction cues in [brackets]
   - Including timing estimates for each section

7. DON'T use manipulative emotional appeals that misrepresent the cause
8. DON'T include visuals that could potentially stigmatize beneficiaries
</CONSTRAINTS>

<CONTEXT>
Nonprofit video content serves multiple purposes:
- Donor engagement and fundraising
- Program explanation and beneficiary outreach
- Volunteer recruitment and training
- Advocacy and awareness building
- Impact reporting and transparency

Videos for nonprofits must balance several considerations:
- Resource constraints (budget, equipment, expertise)
- Multiple stakeholder needs (donors, beneficiaries, staff, board)
- Compliance with grant requirements and ethical standards
- Accessibility for diverse audiences
- Measurement of engagement and conversion metrics

The adaptation process must preserve the integrity of the original content while optimizing for visual storytelling. This includes considering how to represent abstract concepts, maintain dignity of beneficiaries, and create emotional connection without exploitation.

<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
**Example #1: Converting a Program Description to Recruitment Video Script**

**Input:**
Our Youth Mentorship Program pairs experienced professionals with at-risk youth ages 12-18 for weekly mentoring sessions. Mentors commit to a minimum of 6 months, meeting with their mentee for 2 hours each week. Activities include homework help, career exploration, and recreational outings. Our program has shown a 75% improvement in school attendance and a 68% increase in academic performance among participants. Mentors receive comprehensive training and ongoing support from our staff. To qualify, mentors must pass a background check, complete 10 hours of training, and have professional experience in their field.

**Thoughts:**
This is a program description focused on mentor recruitment. The key elements are the program structure, impact statistics, and mentor requirements. For a video, I need to create a narrative flow, add visual elements, and make an emotional connection while maintaining all key information. I'll structure it with a hook about impact, explain the program visually, and end with a clear call to action.

**Output:**

**TITLE**: "Be The Difference: Join Our Youth Mentorship Program"

**VIDEO SPECIFICATIONS**:
- Target Length: 90 seconds
- Primary Platform: Website and social media
- Target Audience: Potential mentors (professionals ages 25-65)

**SCRIPT**:

**HOOK (0:00-0:10)**

**MAIN CONTENT (0:25-1:10)**
"Here's how it works: We carefully match professionals like you with youth ages 12-18 who need additional support."
[Visual: Show the matching process with staff reviewing profiles]

"You'll meet weekly for about two hours, helping with homework, exploring career options, or simply being a consistent, positive presence."

**TECHNICAL NOTES**:
- Music: Upbeat but not overpowering instrumental
- Captions: Essential for all dialogue
- Graphic overlays: Use organization colors for statistics and requirements
- B-roll: Focus on authentic interactions, not staged or overly polished scenes

**ADAPTATION SUMMARY**:
- Key messages preserved: Program structure, impact statistics, mentor requirements
- Strategic changes: Added emotional hook, visualized the mentorship process, simplified application steps
- A/B testing suggestion: Test different hooks - impact statistics vs. emotional appeal

**Example #2: Converting Annual Report Content to Impact Video Script**

**Input:**
In 2023, [ORGANIZATION_NAME] provided clean water access to 15 communities across rural Ethiopia, benefiting approximately 12,500 individuals. We constructed 23 new wells and rehabilitated 17 existing water points. Our water quality testing program ensured all sources met WHO standards for safety. Community water committees were established in each village, with 65% female representation in leadership roles. Local maintenance technicians received training, with 45 individuals now certified to perform repairs. Sustainability metrics show 92% of our water points from previous years remain operational. This work was made possible through $1.2M in funding from institutional donors (65%), individual supporters (30%), and corporate partnerships (5%).

**Thoughts:**
This is statistical impact reporting that needs to be transformed into a visual story. I'll need to humanize the numbers while maintaining accuracy, create a narrative flow that shows both process and impact, and ensure the donor appreciation is prominent. Visual elements should include both the technical aspects (wells, training) and human impact (communities using water).

**Output:**

**TITLE**: "Flowing Impact: Your Support in Action"

**VIDEO SPECIFICATIONS**:
- Target Length: 2 minutes
