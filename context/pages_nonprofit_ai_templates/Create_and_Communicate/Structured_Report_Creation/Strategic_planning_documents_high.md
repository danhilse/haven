<CONTEXT>
Strategic planning for nonprofits differs from corporate planning in several important ways:

1. **Mission-Driven Focus**: Nonprofit strategic plans center on advancing a social mission rather than profit maximization.

2. **Multiple Stakeholders**: Nonprofits must balance the needs and interests of diverse stakeholders including board members, staff, volunteers, donors, funders, community members, and program participants.

3. **Resource Constraints**: Most nonprofits operate with limited resources and must be realistic about capacity while still being aspirational.

4. **Impact Measurement**: Success is measured through social impact and mission advancement rather than financial returns.

5. **Volunteer Engagement**: Many nonprofits rely heavily on volunteer leadership and support, which must be factored into implementation planning.

6. **Funding Complexity**: Nonprofits often have diverse and sometimes unpredictable funding streams that must be considered in strategic planning.

7. **Regulatory Environment**: Nonprofits must operate within specific legal and regulatory frameworks that affect strategic decisions.

8. **Collaborative Approach**: Effective nonprofit strategy often involves partnerships and collaborations rather than competitive positioning.

The strategic planning document should serve as both an internal roadmap and an external communication tool that demonstrates organizational focus, credibility, and impact potential to funders and partners.

### Example #1: Environmental Conservation Nonprofit

**Input:**
- Organization: GreenEarth Alliance
- Mission: To protect and restore natural ecosystems through community engagement and advocacy
- Current programs: Habitat restoration, environmental education, policy advocacy
- Challenges: Limited funding, small staff, increasing climate impacts
- Opportunities: Growing public interest in climate action, potential for new partnerships
- Stakeholder input: Need for more youth engagement, desire to expand geographic reach

**Thoughts:**
This organization needs a strategic plan that balances ambitious conservation goals with realistic capacity constraints. Their three main strategic priorities should focus on program expansion, organizational sustainability, and increased community impact. The implementation plan needs to phase activities to prevent staff burnout.

**Output Excerpt (Strategic Priorities Section):**

## STRATEGIC PRIORITIES 2023-2026

### PRIORITY 1: EXPAND ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION IMPACT
GreenEarth Alliance will increase the scale and effectiveness of our habitat restoration work to create measurable improvements in ecosystem health across our service region.

**Rationale:** Our restoration work has demonstrated significant positive outcomes in pilot areas, and stakeholder feedback indicates strong community support for expansion. Climate change impacts make this work increasingly urgent.

**Connection to Mission:** Directly advances our core purpose of protecting and restoring natural ecosystems.

**SMART Goals:**
1. Increase restored habitat acreage by 50% (from 200 to 300 acres) by December 2025.
2. Establish restoration projects in three new watershed areas by June 2024.
3. Develop and implement standardized ecological monitoring protocols across all restoration sites by March 2024.
