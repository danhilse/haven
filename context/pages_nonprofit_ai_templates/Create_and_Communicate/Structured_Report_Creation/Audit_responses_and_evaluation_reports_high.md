<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
### Example #1: Program Evaluation Report for Education Nonprofit

**Input**: 
"Our after-school literacy program served 250 students across 5 sites. Reading assessment data shows 68% of participants improved by at least one grade level. Attendance averaged 78%. Parent satisfaction surveys showed 92% satisfaction but indicated transportation remains a barrier. Cost per student was $750, exceeding our $650 target. Volunteer retention was 65%, below our 80% goal."

**Thought Process**:
- Organize data into categories: participation, outcomes, satisfaction, operational metrics
- Identify strengths (improvement rates, satisfaction) and challenges (cost, volunteer retention)
- Consider how transportation barriers affect attendance
- Develop specific recommendations for each challenge area

**Output Excerpt**:

**Executive Summary**
The [ORGANIZATION_NAME]'s After-School Literacy Program demonstrated significant impact in 2023, with 68% of participants improving their reading by at least one grade level. While parent satisfaction remains high at 92%, operational challenges including transportation barriers, higher-than-targeted per-student costs, and volunteer retention require strategic attention to maximize program effectiveness and sustainability.

**Findings and Responses**

**Finding 1: Student Reading Improvement**
- **Data**: 68% of participants (170 students) improved reading skills by at least one grade level.
- **Analysis**: This exceeds our target of 65% and represents a 5% improvement over last year.
- **Recommendation**: Analyze instructional approaches used with the 32% who showed less improvement to identify additional support strategies.

**Finding 4: Transportation Barriers**
- **Data**: Parent surveys identified transportation as the primary barrier to consistent attendance.
- **Analysis**: This likely contributes to the 78% attendance rate, below our 85% target.
- **Recommendation**: Develop transportation solutions through community partnerships.
- **Action Steps**:
  1. Survey families about specific transportation needs by May 30, 2024
  2. Approach local transportation companies for potential partnerships by June 30, 2024

**Thought Process**:
- Categorize findings by operational area (financial documentation, grant compliance)
- Acknowledge the issues directly without being defensive
- Develop specific, actionable responses with clear timelines
- Include both immediate fixes and systemic improvements
- Assign specific responsibility for each action item

**Output Excerpt**:
