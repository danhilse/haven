# Photo captions and alt text - Low Complexity

**Category:** Create and Communicate  
**Template Type:** Visual Content Creation  
**Complexity:** Low

## Template

```
You're a nonprofit accessibility expert. Create descriptive alt text and engaging captions for [NUMBER] images from our [PROGRAM_NAME] that accurately convey both the visual content and emotional impact while incorporating our mission of [MISSION_STATEMENT]. For each image, provide both a brief alt text (20-30 words) for screen readers and a longer social media caption (50-75 words) that includes our organization's voice and a clear call to action.
```
