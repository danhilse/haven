### Example #1: Environmental Conservation Nonprofit Annual Report Presentation

**Input:**
We need slide designs for Ocean Guardians' annual report presentation to our major donors. We need to showcase our coral reef restoration program, highlight our 30% increase in marine protected areas, and include testimonials from community partners. Our brand colors are blue (#0077B6) and green (#2E8B57). The presentation will be delivered at our annual gala.

**Thoughts:**
This is an environmental nonprofit needing to showcase both quantitative impact (30% increase) and qualitative impact (testimonials). The audience is major donors at a formal event, so the design should be polished but authentic to marine conservation work. I'll create designs for an impact data slide and a testimonial slide that balance professionalism with mission alignment.

**Output:**

## 1. Design Strategy Overview
- **Visual Approach**: Ocean-inspired designs using organic shapes and gradients that evoke marine environments
- **Color Palette**: Primary: Ocean Blue (#0077B6), Seagrass Green (#2E8B57); Complementary: Coral (#FF7F50), Sand (#F5DEB3)
- **Typography**: Headings: Montserrat Bold (free Google font); Body: Open Sans (free Google font)
- **Accessibility**: All text will maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum; data visualizations will use patterns in addition to colors

## 2. Slide-by-Slide Design Specifications

  * Radial chart showing protected area growth
  * Subtle wave pattern as section divider
- **Accessibility Notes**: Ensure chart uses both color and pattern differentiation; add alt text describing the data trend

### Testimonial Slide: Community Partners
- **Visual Concept**: Quote-focused design with authentic community imagery
- **DALL-E Prompt**: "A professional, respectful image of diverse community members working together on a beach conservation project. Natural lighting, authentic candid style, not posed or stock-photo looking. Subtle blue overlay that would allow white text to be readable. Appropriate for an environmental nonprofit presentation."
- **Layout Specification**:
  * Background: Full-bleed DALL-E generated image with 30% blue overlay
  * Center: Large quotation marks in Ocean Blue (#0077B6) at 30% opacity
  * Middle: Testimonial text in white Open Sans (28pt)
  * Bottom right: Attribution with community partner name and role
- **Design Elements**:
  * Subtle wave graphic element in bottom corner
  * Optional small portrait of the quoted individual if available
  * Thin green line underneath attribution
- **Accessibility Notes**: Ensure text contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1); provide alt text describing both the image and the quote's key message

We need to explain how the program works, show our success metrics (85% appointment completion rate), and outline the partnership benefits. Our colors are purple (#663399) and teal (#008080). This will be presented in hospital boardrooms.

**Thoughts:**
This healthcare nonprofit needs to present a program overview to potential partners in a professional healthcare setting.
