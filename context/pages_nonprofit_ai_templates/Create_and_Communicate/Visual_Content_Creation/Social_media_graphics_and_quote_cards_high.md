<CONTEXT>
Nonprofits face unique challenges when creating visual content:

1. **Resource Limitations:** Many nonprofits have limited design budgets and staff capacity, requiring solutions that can be implemented with basic tools like Canva.

2. **Stakeholder Sensitivity:** Visual representation of beneficiaries, communities, and sensitive issues requires careful consideration to avoid exploitation or stereotyping.

3. **Brand Consistency:** Maintaining consistent visual identity across volunteer-created content can be challenging but is essential for recognition.

4. **Impact Communication:** Effectively communicating complex impact data or emotional stories through simple visuals requires strategic design thinking.

5. **Multi-Channel Needs:** Nonprofits often need to reach diverse audiences across multiple platforms with limited resources to create platform-specific content.

6. **Accessibility Requirements:** Many nonprofits serve diverse populations with varying abilities, making accessibility a core requirement rather than an afterthought.

7. **Call-to-Action Focus:** Nonprofit visuals often need to drive specific actions (donate, volunteer, advocate) while maintaining mission focus.

<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
**Example #1: Impact Statistic Graphic**

**Input:**
We need a graphic highlighting that our food bank [FOOD_SECURITY_NONPROFIT] distributed 250,000 meals to families in need last year. Our colors are navy blue (#0A3161) and orange (#FF8C42). Target platform is Instagram. We want to convey both impact and urgency for continued support.

**Thoughts:**
This graphic needs to balance the celebration of impact with the ongoing need. A food-related visual that shows abundance rather than scarcity would be more positive. The statistic should be the focal point, with supporting text providing context. Instagram square format works best with a clean, bold design.

**Output:**

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Core message: Significant impact (250,000 meals) with implied need for continued support
   - Target audience: Instagram users, potential donors and volunteers
   - Platform: Instagram square format (1080x1080px)
   - Goal: Generate appreciation for impact while motivating continued support

Our brand colors are teal (#008080) and purple (#5D3FD3). This will be shared on LinkedIn and Facebook to attract potential mentors.

**Thoughts:**
This testimonial focuses on transformation and possibility, so the visual should convey growth, horizons, or new perspectives. Since it's targeting potential mentors on professional platforms, the design should be inspirational but professional. The quote is powerful and should be the central focus.

**Output:**

1. **Content Analysis**
   - Core message: Personal transformation through mentorship
   - Target audience: Potential mentors, professional audience
   - Platforms: LinkedIn and Facebook
   - Goal: Inspire professionals to volunteer as mentors

   - Simplified version: Solid color background option if gradient causes readability issues
   - Readability: Test text visibility against all areas of gradient background

6. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Canva implementation: Use gradient background feature, frame the quote with quotation marks
