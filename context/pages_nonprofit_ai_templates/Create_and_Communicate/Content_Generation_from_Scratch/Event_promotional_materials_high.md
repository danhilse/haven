<CONTEXT>
Nonprofit events serve multiple purposes beyond the event itself:
- Raising awareness about the organization's mission
- Building community among supporters
- Fundraising directly or cultivating donor relationships
- Providing services or education to beneficiaries
- Celebrating achievements and recognizing contributors

Effective promotional materials must balance these organizational objectives with attendee benefits. Consider the following contextual factors:
- Resource constraints (limited budget for promotion)
- Volunteer involvement in promotion and execution
- Potential for partner/sponsor co-promotion
- Need for materials to be repurposable across channels
- Importance of measuring promotional effectiveness
- Alignment with broader organizational communication strategy
