<CONTEXT>
### Nonprofit Podcast Considerations:
- Nonprofit podcasts typically operate with limited production resources and staff time
- Episodes often need to serve multiple purposes: education, advocacy, fundraising, community building
- Content must balance compelling storytelling with clear organizational messaging
- Podcasts are a relationship-building tool that should deepen audience connection to the mission
- Show notes and social content are critical for extending reach beyond direct listeners
- Metrics of success include not just downloads but also conversion to donors, volunteers, or advocates

### Audience Engagement Factors:
- Nonprofit audiences typically want both emotional connection AND practical information
- Listeners may include current donors, potential donors, volunteers, beneficiaries, and peer organizations
- Content should be accessible to newcomers while still valuable to those familiar with the cause
- Different platforms (website, social media, podcast directories) may reach different audience segments
- Podcast content should complement other communication channels, not duplicate them

### Technical Considerations:
- Show notes should be optimized for SEO with relevant keywords and structured content
- Social media content should be platform-appropriate in length, tone, and format
- Timestamps improve accessibility and user experience
- Resource links should be trackable when possible (UTM parameters)
- Content should be easily repurposable for newsletters, annual reports, and grant applications

   🌳 TREES AS MEDICINE? Science says YES!

   In our new podcast episode, Dr. Maria Chen explains how neighborhood green spaces are literally saving lives—reducing depression by 25%, lowering dangerous urban heat by up to 15°F, and improving respiratory health.

   The problem? These benefits aren't equally distributed. Low-income neighborhoods have 40% less tree coverage on average.

   That's why our Green Blocks Initiative is focusing on underserved communities. Listen to the full episode and learn how you can help bring green space equity to our city!
