### Nonprofit Survey Analysis Context
- Nonprofits often collect survey data from multiple stakeholder groups (beneficiaries, donors, volunteers, staff, community members)
- Survey data helps demonstrate program effectiveness to funders and board members
- Resource constraints may limit the sophistication of data collection methods
- Qualitative feedback is often as valuable as quantitative metrics in the nonprofit context
- Survey insights should ultimately connect to advancing the organization's mission
- Nonprofit surveys often need to balance impact measurement with stakeholder experience
- Data may need to be analyzed through an equity lens to ensure all voices are represented
- Insights should consider both immediate program improvements and long-term strategic direction
- Recommendations must be practical given typical nonprofit staffing and budget limitations
- Survey analysis may inform grant applications, annual reports, and strategic planning

## Usage Instructions

### When to Use This Template
- After conducting stakeholder surveys (beneficiary feedback, donor satisfaction, volunteer experience, etc.)
- When evaluating program effectiveness or participant outcomes
- For annual community needs assessments
- To analyze feedback from events, workshops, or training sessions
- When preparing for strategic planning or board presentations

### Required Inputs
1. Complete survey data (quantitative and qualitative responses)
2. Your organization's mission statement
3. Target audience information
4. Specific analysis objectives or strategic questions
5. Any previous survey results for comparison (if available)

### Customization Tips
- Replace [ORGANIZATION_NAME], [PROGRAM_NAME], [MISSION_STATEMENT], and [TARGET_AUDIENCE] with your specific information
- Adjust the demographic segments in the output format to match your survey respondents
- Add specific strategic questions unique to your organization's current challenges
- Modify the output format to match your internal reporting requirements
- For very large surveys, consider breaking analysis into multiple segments (e.g., by stakeholder type)

### Best Practices
- Provide complete survey data rather than summaries for the most accurate analysis
- Include both quantitative (ratings, multiple choice) and qualitative (open-ended) responses
- Be specific about what decisions the survey insights will inform
- Consider using ChatGPT-o3 for more nuanced analysis of complex qualitative responses
- Review recommendations for feasibility before implementation

### Troubleshooting
- If recommendations seem too generic: Provide more context about your organization's specific constraints and strategic priorities
- If analysis lacks depth: Ensure you've included all qualitative responses and demographic data
- If outputs are too lengthy: Request a condensed executive summary version
- If certain stakeholder groups seem overlooked: Specifically request analysis of those segments.
