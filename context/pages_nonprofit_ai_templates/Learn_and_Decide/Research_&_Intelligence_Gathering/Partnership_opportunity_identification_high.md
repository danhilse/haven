<CONTEXT>
Partnership development for nonprofits requires strategic thinking that balances mission advancement with practical resource considerations. Effective partnerships should create mutual value while advancing the organization's theory of change.

Consider these partnership models:
1. RESOURCE SHARING: Sharing staff, space, technology, or other resources
2. COLLABORATIVE PROGRAMMING: Joint program delivery to expand reach or services
3. COLLECTIVE IMPACT: Multi-stakeholder approach to complex social problems
4. FUNDING PARTNERSHIPS: Joint fundraising or fiscal sponsorship arrangements
5. KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE: Sharing expertise, data, or learning resources
6. ADVOCACY COALITIONS: Joining forces to influence policy or public opinion
7. SOCIAL ENTERPRISE COLLABORATIONS: Partnerships that generate revenue while advancing mission
8. CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: Engaging businesses in supporting nonprofit work

Effective nonprofit partnerships typically progress through these stages:
1. Exploration and relationship building
2. Alignment of vision and goals
3. Formalization of partnership structure
4. Implementation and resource allocation
5. Evaluation and adaptation
6. Sustainability planning or responsible conclusion

Partnership success factors include:
- Clear communication channels
- Defined roles and responsibilities
- Shared measurement systems
- Mutual accountability mechanisms
- Adaptive management processes
- Celebration of shared successes

Example #1: Environmental Conservation Nonprofit

Input:
- Organization: GreenRivers Alliance
- Mission: Protect and restore river ecosystems through conservation, education, and advocacy
- Strategic priorities: Expand watershed monitoring program, develop youth education initiatives, increase policy influence
- Current partnerships: Local schools, state environmental agency, two corporate sponsors
- Target audience: Community members, students, policymakers
- Geographic focus: Northeastern region, primarily rural communities
- Resource gaps: Technical expertise in data analysis, sustainable funding, volunteer management

Thoughts:
This organization needs partnerships that can enhance their technical capabilities while expanding their reach. They have education programs but need more technical expertise. Their policy work could benefit from coalition partnerships. They need sustainable funding models beyond traditional grants.

<RECAP>
When using this template to identify partnership opportunities for your nonprofit:

1. FOCUS ON MISSION ALIGNMENT FIRST
   Always prioritize partnerships that directly advance your organization's mission and theory of change. Even the most resource-rich partnership will fail if it pulls your organization away from its core purpose.

2. CONSIDER IMPLEMENTATION CAPACITY
   Be realistic about your organization's capacity to manage partnerships. Each partnership requires staff time, communication channels, and ongoing relationship management.

3. EVALUATE ACROSS MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS
   Use both quantitative scoring (1-10 scales) and qualitative assessment to evaluate opportunities. Consider mission alignment, resource complementarity, implementation feasibility, and potential impact.

4. DEVELOP DIVERSE PARTNERSHIP PORTFOLIO
   Seek a mix of partnership types (funding, operational, programmatic) and partner sectors (nonprofit, corporate, government, academic) to create a resilient partnership ecosystem.

5. PLAN FOR PARTNERSHIP LIFECYCLE
   Include considerations for how partnerships will evolve over time, from initial exploration to formalization, implementation, evaluation, and either renewal or responsible conclusion.

6. CUSTOMIZE THE ANALYSIS
   Adapt the evaluation criteria to reflect your organization's specific priorities, constraints, and strategic goals. Add sector-specific considerations relevant to your mission area.

7. INCLUDE ACTIONABLE NEXT STEPS
   Ensure your analysis concludes with specific, time-bound actions that staff can implement to pursue the most promising opportunities.

Remember to replace all placeholder variables ([ORGANIZATION_NAME], [MISSION_STATEMENT], [TARGET_AUDIENCE], etc.) with your specific information before using this template.
