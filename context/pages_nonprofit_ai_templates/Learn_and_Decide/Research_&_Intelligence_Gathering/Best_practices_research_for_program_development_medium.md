   - Core implementation requirements (staffing, resources, training)
   - Expected outcomes and impact metrics
   - Potential adaptation challenges for nonprofits with limited resources
   - Success factors from similar organizations
3. Consider our specific context: [GEOGRAPHIC_AREA], [AVAILABLE_RESOURCES], and [ORGANIZATIONAL_CONSTRAINTS]
4. Search for case studies of similar programs that have demonstrated measurable impact
5. Identify potential funding sources, partnerships, or capacity-building resources that could support implementation
</STEPS>

<OUTPUT>
Provide your findings in this format:
1. Executive Summary (3-5 key takeaways)
2. Best Practices Analysis (detailed breakdown of each practice)
3. Implementation Considerations (resource requirements, timeline, phasing options)
4. Measurement Framework (suggested metrics to track program success)
5. Resource List (organizations, toolkits, funding opportunities)
6. References (all sources consulted)
