<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
**Example #1: Data Privacy Compliance Research**

**Input:**
Our education nonprofit [YOUTH_LEARNING_ALLIANCE] needs to understand what data privacy regulations apply to our after-school tutoring program that collects student information. We operate in California and receive some federal education funding. Please research applicable regulations including FERPA, COPPA, and California-specific requirements.

**Thoughts:**
This requires research on multiple regulatory frameworks:
1. Federal education privacy law (FERPA) 
2. Children's online privacy (COPPA)
3. California-specific privacy laws (CCPA/CPRA)
4. How these intersect for nonprofits with partial federal funding
5. Specific requirements for educational program data

**Output:**

# REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RESEARCH: YOUTH DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Youth Learning Alliance must comply with multiple overlapping data privacy regulations due to your work with minors, educational focus, and California location. Key findings include:

* **FERPA Applicability**: As a recipient of federal education funding, you must protect student educational records with specific consent requirements
* **COPPA Requirements**: For any online services directed to children under 13, verifiable parental consent is mandatory
* **California-Specific Obligations**: CCPA/CPRA creates additional rights for California residents, though nonprofits have limited exemptions
* **Highest Priority Actions**: Implement comprehensive data inventory, develop consent mechanisms, establish data security protocols

## REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

**Example #2: Charitable Registration Compliance Research**

**Input:**
[GLOBAL_RELIEF_NETWORK] is expanding our fundraising to include online donations from supporters nationwide. We're currently registered in our home state of New York. Please research which states require charitable solicitation registration for nonprofits accepting online donations and the process for multi-state compliance.

**Thoughts:**
This requires research on:

2. How online fundraising affects registration obligations
3. Multi-state registration processes and exemptions
4. Nonprofit-specific considerations and thresholds
5. Ongoing compliance requirements

**Output:**
