<CONTEXT>
Policy analysis for nonprofits differs from corporate or academic analysis in several important ways:

1. **Mission-Centric Lens**: Nonprofits evaluate policy through the lens of mission advancement and community impact, not profit or purely academic interest.

2. **Resource Constraints**: Most nonprofits have limited capacity for policy monitoring and response, requiring focused, efficient analysis.

3. **Stakeholder Complexity**: Nonprofits must consider impacts across diverse stakeholders including beneficiaries, funders, partners, and communities.

4. **Advocacy Considerations**: Many nonprofits engage in advocacy within legal constraints, requiring nuanced understanding of lobbying rules and advocacy tactics.

5. **Funding Implications**: Policy changes often directly affect nonprofit funding streams, requiring financial impact assessment.

6. **Cross-Sector Perspective**: Effective nonprofit policy analysis considers public, private, and nonprofit sector interactions.

7. **Values Alignment**: Policy recommendations must align with organizational values and ethical commitments.

8. **Community Voice Integration**: Authentic policy analysis incorporates the perspectives of affected communities.
