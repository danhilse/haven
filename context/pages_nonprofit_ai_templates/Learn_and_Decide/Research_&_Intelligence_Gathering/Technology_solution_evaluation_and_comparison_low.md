## Template

```
As a nonprofit technology advisor, help me evaluate and compare [TECHNOLOGY_SOLUTION_TYPE] options for [ORGANIZATION_NAME] by searching for the latest reviews, pricing models, nonprofit discounts, and implementation requirements for [SPECIFIC_SOLUTION_1], [SPECIFIC_SOLUTION_2], and [SPECIFIC_SOLUTION_3]. Create a comparison table with key features, costs, pros/cons, and compatibility with our existing systems, then recommend the best option based on our size, budget constraints of [BUDGET_AMOUNT], and primary need to [PRIMARY_NEED].
