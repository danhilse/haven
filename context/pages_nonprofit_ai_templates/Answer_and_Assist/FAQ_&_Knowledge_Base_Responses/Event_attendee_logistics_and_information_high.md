Example #1:
Input: "What time does the event start and where exactly is it located?"

Thoughts: This is a logistics question about timing and location. I need to provide specific details from the schedule and venue sections of the knowledge base.

Output:
Hi there! Thanks for your question about our [EVENT_NAME].

**Start Time:** The event officially begins at [START_TIME] on [EVENT_DATE], with check-in opening at [CHECK_IN_TIME].

**Location:** We'll be at [VENUE_NAME], located at [VENUE_ADDRESS]. Here's what you need to know:
- The main entrance is on [STREET_NAME]
- Accessible entrances are available on the [LOCATION] side
- Look for our [ORGANIZATION_NAME] banners and volunteer greeters

If you're using GPS, I recommend entering "[GPS_ADDRESS]" for the most accurate directions.

Is there anything else you need to know about getting to the event? I'm happy to help with parking information or public transportation options!

Example #2:
Input: "I have dietary restrictions. Will there be food options for me?"

Thoughts: This is a question about accommodations and food service. I should check the catering section of the knowledge base and provide specific information about menu options while being sensitive to dietary needs.

Hello! I appreciate you asking about dietary options at [EVENT_NAME].

We're committed to providing food choices for various dietary needs. Our menu will include:

- **Vegan choices:** [VEGAN_MENU_ITEMS]
- **Gluten-free selections:** [GLUTEN_FREE_MENU_ITEMS]

All food stations will have clear labeling for common allergens including nuts, dairy, soy, and gluten.

2. Log in to your account on our registration platform at [REGISTRATION_SITE]
