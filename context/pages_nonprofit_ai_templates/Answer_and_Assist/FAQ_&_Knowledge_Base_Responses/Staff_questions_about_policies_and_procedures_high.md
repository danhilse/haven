### Example #1: Time-Off Request Question

**Input:** "How much notice do I need to give for taking vacation time? I want to take a week off next month."

**Thoughts:** This is an HR policy question about time-off requests. I need to check the Employee Handbook for the vacation request policy, including notice periods and approval process. The question is straightforward and doesn't require escalation.

**Output:**
**Policy Question:** How much notice is required for vacation time requests?

**Answer Summary:** Staff must submit vacation requests at least 2 weeks in advance for periods of 3+ days, and at least 3 days in advance for shorter periods.

**Policy Reference:** Employee Handbook, Section 4.2 "Paid Time Off," page 18, last updated January 2023

**Detailed Explanation:**
Our vacation request policy requires different notice periods based on the length of time requested:
- For 1-2 days: Minimum 3 business days' notice
- For 3+ days: Minimum 2 weeks' notice
- For 2+ weeks: Minimum 1 month's notice

### Example #2: Financial Approval Question

**Input:** "I need to purchase some supplies for our upcoming community event. What's the process for getting this approved?"

**Thoughts:** This is a financial procedure question about purchasing approval. I should check the Financial Procedures Manual for purchase authorization levels, required documentation, and the approval workflow.

**Output:**
**Policy Question:** What is the process for purchasing supplies for a program event?

**Answer Summary:** Purchases under $500 require supervisor approval; $500-$2,500 require department head approval; over $2,500 require executive approval.

**Policy Reference:** Financial Procedures Manual, Section 3.4 "Purchase Authorization," pages 12-14, last updated March 2023

Our purchasing approval process follows these steps:

1. Complete a Purchase Request Form that includes:

### Example #3: Sensitive HR Matter

**Input:** "One of my team members has been consistently arriving late. What's our policy on tardiness and how should I handle this?"

**Thoughts:** This involves personnel management and potential disciplinary action. While I can provide the general policy, specific handling of employee performance issues requires HR guidance and should be partially escalated.

**Output:**
**Policy Question:** What is our policy on employee tardiness and how should it be addressed?

**Answer Summary:** Consistent tardiness should be documented and addressed through our progressive discipline process, beginning with verbal coaching.

**Policy Reference:** Employee Handbook, Section 2.3 "Attendance and Punctuality," page 8, and Section 7.1 "Progressive Discipline," pages 32-33, last updated January 2023

**Detailed Explanation:**
Our attendance policy states that employees are expected to arrive on time for their scheduled shifts. Occasional tardiness (1-2 instances per month) may be addressed informally, but consistent tardiness (3+ instances per month) should be addressed through our progressive discipline process:

1. Verbal coaching and documentation
2. Written warning
3. Performance improvement plan
4. Final warning
5. Termination

Each situation should be evaluated individually, considering factors like:
- Communication (did the employee notify their supervisor?)
- Pattern (same day of week, following certain events)
- Impact on operations and other team members
- Extenuating circumstances (transportation, family care, etc.)

**Next Steps:**
1. Document the pattern of tardiness you've observed
2. Schedule a private conversation with the employee
3. Consult with HR before proceeding to formal written warnings
