Example #2: Financial Hardship Affecting Participation

**Situation Assessment**:
You're facing two main obstacles to continuing with the program: the transportation costs you can no longer afford and the potential need to schedule new employment during our meeting times. These are practical challenges stemming from your recent job loss, but they don't necessarily mean you need to leave the program you value.

**Immediate Support Options**:
1. Our Participant Support Fund was created for situations exactly like yours. We can provide transportation assistance in the form of bus passes or gas cards to cover your travel to weekly meetings for the next two months while you stabilize your situation. To access this support, simply complete the brief assistance request form I'll email you today.

2. We offer flexible participation options that might help during your job transition. You can attend meetings virtually for up to one month, and we can work with you to create a modified schedule if you need to miss occasional meetings for job interviews or work.

3. Our Career Support Coordinator, Jamie, specializes in helping participants find employment that complements their program schedule. Jamie can meet with you this week to discuss job opportunities that would allow you to continue attending our weekly sessions.

**Additional Resources**:
- Our organization partners with the Community Financial Empowerment Center, which offers free emergency financial counseling and job search assistance. They can help you develop a budget and financial plan during this transition.
- The program alumni network maintains a job board with flexible positions that past participants have found compatible with program commitments.

**Next Steps and Follow-up**:
I'll call you tomorrow to discuss which support options would be most helpful for your situation. In the meantime, I'll email you the Participant Support Fund application and information about scheduling a meeting with our Career Support Coordinator. Please know that you don't need to make any decisions about continuing the program until we've explored all available support options.
