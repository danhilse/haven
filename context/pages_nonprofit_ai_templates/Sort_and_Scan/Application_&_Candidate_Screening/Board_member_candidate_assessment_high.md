   - Organizations in transition need change management experience

3. **Consider board dynamics:**
   - Complementary skills among board members
   - Personality fit and collaborative potential
   - Power dynamics and inclusive governance
   - Succession planning for key board roles

4. **Reflect on legal and ethical requirements:**

<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
### Example #1: Strong Candidate Assessment

**Input:**
- Candidate: Maria Rodriguez
- Position: Board Member for Community Health Nonprofit
- Materials: Resume, application form, statement of interest
- Rubric: Standard board assessment with emphasis on healthcare expertise, community connections, and fundraising

**Thoughts:**
Maria has 15+ years in healthcare administration with direct experience in community clinics serving our target population. Her statement shows deep understanding of health equity issues. She serves on two other boards (potential time constraint but brings governance experience). Has extensive community connections and demonstrated fundraising success. Mission alignment is very strong based on her personal story and professional choices.

**Output:**
# BOARD CANDIDATE ASSESSMENT: MARIA RODRIGUEZ

## SUMMARY SCORECARD
- **Overall Score:** 87/100
- **Recommendation:** Highly Recommend
- **Key Strengths:** Healthcare expertise, community connections, governance experience
- **Development Areas:** Time availability, technology innovation knowledge

## DETAILED CRITERIA ASSESSMENT

### Mission & Values Alignment
- **Score:** 5
- **Evidence:** Statement directly references personal experience with healthcare access issues in immigrant communities. Professional career shows consistent commitment to health equity.
- **Notes:** Authentic connection to mission is evident throughout application materials.

### Professional Experience & Expertise
- **Score:** 5
- **Evidence:** 15 years in healthcare administration including 7 years as Director of Operations at Community Health Partners. MBA with healthcare focus.
- **Notes:** Experience directly relevant to organization's work and strategic challenges.

### Governance Knowledge
- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence:** Currently serves on two nonprofit boards. Completed BoardSource governance training in 2021.
- **Notes:** Demonstrates understanding of board/staff boundaries in application responses.

### Strategic Thinking
- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence:** Led strategic planning process at current organization. Application answers show systems-level thinking.
- **Notes:** Identifies key industry trends that will impact organization's future.

### Resource Development Capacity
- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence:** Led capital campaign raising $2.3M. Personal connections to two major healthcare foundations.
- **Notes:** Explicitly willing to participate in fundraising activities.

### Community Connections
- **Score:** 5
- **Evidence:** Active in Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, County Health Coalition, and Regional Hospital Association.
- **Notes:** Connections span both professional healthcare networks and community-based organizations.

### Diversity & Inclusion Contribution
- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence:** Bilingual Spanish/English. First-generation college graduate. Experience developing culturally responsive healthcare programs.
- **Notes:** Would bring important perspective currently missing from board.

### Time Availability & Commitment
- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence:** Currently serves on two other boards. Notes availability for monthly meetings and quarterly committee work.
- **Notes:** Potential concern about overcommitment, but demonstrates efficient time management.

## ORGANIZATIONAL FIT ANALYSIS
Maria would fill a critical gap in healthcare operations expertise on the current board, which currently has clinical representation but lacks administrative experience. Her extensive community connections complement the board's current composition, which is strong in corporate partnerships but weaker in grassroots engagement. Her bilingual abilities and cultural background would enhance the board's capacity to understand the needs of the organization's primary service population.

The current board lacks representation from the Hispanic community despite serving a 40% Hispanic client base, making Maria's perspective particularly valuable. Her governance experience would also benefit the three first-time board members who joined last year.

## RECOMMENDATION RATIONALE
Maria is highly recommended based on her exceptional alignment with the organization's mission, directly relevant professional expertise, and strong community connections. Her governance experience and resource development capacity address key needs identified in the board composition analysis. The only significant concern is her time availability given other board commitments, but her demonstrated efficiency and explicit commitment to the required time investment mitigate this concern.

## SUGGESTED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
1. Given your commitments to other boards, how would you prioritize your responsibilities if multiple organizations had competing demands?
2. What specific healthcare industry trends do you believe will most impact our organization in the next 3-5 years?
3. How would you approach building bridges between our organization and the Hispanic community to enhance program participation?

### Example #2: Candidate with Mixed Qualifications

**Input:**
- Candidate: James Wilson
- Position: Board Member for Arts Education Nonprofit
- Materials: Resume, brief cover letter
- Rubric: Standard board assessment with emphasis on arts expertise, education background, and community connections

**Thoughts:**
James has strong financial expertise (CPA, investment management) which addresses a critical board gap. However, limited evidence of connection to arts or education mission. No previous nonprofit board experience but served on corporate advisory committees. Minimal community connections mentioned. Application materials are brief and don't fully address key criteria.

**Output:**
# BOARD CANDIDATE ASSESSMENT: JAMES WILSON

## SUMMARY SCORECARD
- **Overall Score:** 62/100
- **Recommendation:** Consider with Reservations
- **Key Strengths:** Financial expertise, professional network, analytical skills
- **Development Areas:** Mission connection, nonprofit governance knowledge

## DETAILED CRITERIA ASSESSMENT

### Mission & Values Alignment
- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence:** Cover letter mentions "appreciation for the arts" but provides no specific examples or personal connection.
- **Notes:** Limited demonstration of understanding or passion for arts education mission.

### Professional Experience & Expertise
- **Score:** 5
- **Evidence:** 12 years as CPA with investment management specialty. Partner at regional accounting firm.
- **Notes:** Financial expertise directly addresses critical board gap identified in needs assessment.

### Governance Knowledge
- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence:** Served on corporate advisory committees but no nonprofit board experience mentioned.
- **Notes:** Would require significant orientation to nonprofit governance principles.

### Strategic Thinking
- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence:** Resume highlights strategic financial planning for clients. Led firm's strategic planning committee.
- **Notes:** Strong analytical approach but unclear if skills would translate to nonprofit context.

### Resource Development Capacity
- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence:** Professional connections to high-net-worth individuals. No direct fundraising experience mentioned.
- **Notes:** Potential to leverage professional network but comfort with fundraising unclear.

### Community Connections
- **Score:** 2
- **Evidence:** Member of Chamber of Commerce. No connections to arts community or education sector mentioned.
- **Notes:** Limited community engagement evident in materials.

### Diversity & Inclusion Contribution
- **Score:** 3
- **Evidence:** First-generation college graduate. Mentors junior staff from underrepresented groups.
- **Notes:** Some valuable perspective but limited information provided.

### Time Availability & Commitment
- **Score:** 4
- **Evidence:** States availability for monthly meetings and committee work. No competing board commitments.
- **Notes:** Professional demands may impact availability during tax season.

## ORGANIZATIONAL FIT ANALYSIS
James would address the critical need for financial expertise on the board, particularly as the organization approaches a capital campaign for a new facility. His professional background would strengthen the board's financial oversight capacity and potentially improve fiscal policies. However, his limited connection to the arts education mission raises concerns about his ability to serve as an effective ambassador for the organization.

The current board is already heavily weighted toward business professionals, with limited representation from arts practitioners or educators. While James' financial skills are needed, his addition would further this imbalance.

## RECOMMENDATION RATIONALE
James is recommended with reservations primarily due to his exceptional financial expertise that directly addresses a critical board need. However, significant concerns exist regarding his connection to the mission and understanding of the nonprofit sector. His candidacy represents a classic "skills versus passion" dilemma. If selected, a robust orientation to both the organization's mission and nonprofit governance would be essential, along with pairing him with a mentor from the current board.

## SUGGESTED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
1. What personal or professional experiences have shaped your interest in arts education?
2. How do you see the role of a nonprofit board member differing from your corporate advisory committee experience?
3. Beyond financial expertise, what other contributions do you believe you could make to advance our mission?
