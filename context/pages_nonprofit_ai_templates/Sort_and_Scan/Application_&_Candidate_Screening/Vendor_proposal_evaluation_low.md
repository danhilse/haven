## Template

```
As a nonprofit vendor proposal evaluator, analyze the attached [VENDOR_PROPOSALS] against our [EVALUATION_CRITERIA] and provide a ranked list with scores for each vendor on a scale of 1-10 across each criterion, highlighting strengths/weaknesses, and recommending the top 3 candidates that best align with [ORGANIZATION_NAME]'s mission and budget constraints. Include a brief justification for each recommendation and flag any potential red flags or compliance issues that might affect our decision-making process.
