</CONSTRAINTS>

<CONTEXT>
Nonprofit organizations face unique hiring challenges:
- Limited resources for recruitment and competitive compensation
- Need for staff who can wear multiple hats and adapt to changing priorities
- Importance of mission alignment and cultural fit alongside technical qualifications
- Often working with volunteer committees in hiring decisions
- Need for diverse perspectives to effectively serve communities
- Compliance requirements for grant-funded positions
- Potential for candidates transitioning from for-profit to nonprofit sectors

The screening process should acknowledge these realities while maintaining fairness and objectivity. The goal is to identify candidates who will thrive in a mission-driven environment while bringing the necessary skills to advance the organization's work.

Many nonprofits struggle with consistent candidate evaluation, leading to potential bias or missed opportunities. This template creates a standardized approach that can be customized to different positions while maintaining equity in the screening process.

<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
### Example #1: Program Coordinator Position

**Input:**
Job Requirements:
- Bachelor's degree in social work, education, or related field
- Minimum 2 years experience in program coordination
- Proficiency in Microsoft Office and database management
- Experience working with underserved youth
- Strong written and verbal communication skills
- Spanish language proficiency preferred

Candidate Resume Excerpt:
"Education: Associate's degree in Human Services (2018)
Experience: Youth Mentor, City Youth Program (2018-2021)
- Coordinated after-school activities for 25+ youth ages 12-18
- Maintained participant records and program metrics
- Created bilingual materials for Spanish-speaking families
Skills: Fluent in Spanish, Proficient in Microsoft Office, Salesforce database experience
Volunteer: Literacy tutor at community center (2016-present)"

**Thoughts:**
The candidate has an Associate's degree rather than Bachelor's (partial match on education). They have 3 years of relevant experience exceeding the 2-year minimum. They demonstrate database experience, youth work experience, and Spanish fluency (meeting a preferred qualification). Their volunteer work shows mission commitment. The main gap is the degree level.

**Output:**

## Candidate Assessment: Maria Rodriguez

### Scoring Summary
- Required Qualifications: 4/5 - Meets most requirements but has Associate's rather than Bachelor's degree
- Experience Relevance: 5/5 - Direct experience with youth programming and coordination
- Mission Alignment: 5/5 - Long-term volunteer commitment shows dedication to literacy and youth development
- Potential Impact: 4/5 - Demonstrated ability to work with target population and manage program data
- Diversity Contribution: 5/5 - Brings bilingual skills and experience creating inclusive materials
- **Total Score**: 23/25

### Qualification Assessment
- **Tier**: Highly Qualified
- **Key Strengths**: 
  * Fluent Spanish speaker with experience creating bilingual materials
  * Exceeds minimum experience requirement with direct youth program coordination
  * Demonstrated database management skills including Salesforce experience
- **Notable Gaps**: 
  * Associate's degree rather than Bachelor's degree
  * No explicit mention of grant reporting or budget management experience

### Recommendation
Despite lacking a Bachelor's degree, Maria demonstrates exceptional qualifications in all other areas, particularly in direct experience with the target population and bilingual capabilities. Recommend advancing to interview stage to assess how her practical experience might compensate for the educational requirement gap.

### Example #2: Development Director Position

**Input:**
Job Requirements:
- Bachelor's degree required, Master's preferred
- 5+ years fundraising experience in nonprofit sector
- Proven track record of securing major gifts and grants
- Experience with donor database management
- Strong relationship-building and public speaking skills
- Knowledge of planned giving strategies

Candidate Resume Excerpt:
"Education: MBA, State University (2015)
Experience: 
- Corporate Sales Manager, Tech Solutions Inc. (2015-2022)
  * Managed client portfolio worth $3.5M annually
  * Exceeded sales targets by 15% for 5 consecutive years
  * Presented at industry conferences and client meetings
- Board Member, Local Arts Foundation (2018-present)
  * Volunteer fundraising committee chair
  * Helped secure $50K in corporate sponsorships
  * Organized annual gala raising $75K annually"

**Thoughts:**
The candidate has strong educational credentials with an MBA. However, they lack professional fundraising experience, with only volunteer fundraising work. Their sales background provides transferable skills in relationship management and revenue generation, but they don't have experience with grants or planned giving. Their board service shows mission commitment but doesn't fully substitute for professional development experience.

**Output:**

## Candidate Assessment: James Wilson

### Scoring Summary
- Required Qualifications: 2/5 - Has advanced degree but lacks professional fundraising experience
- Experience Relevance: 3/5 - Sales experience offers transferable skills but no direct development work
- Mission Alignment: 4/5 - Board service demonstrates commitment to nonprofit sector
- Potential Impact: 3/5 - Strong relationship and revenue skills but steep learning curve for development specifics
- Diversity Contribution: 4/5 - Brings corporate perspective and potential donor connections
- **Total Score**: 16/25

### Qualification Assessment
- **Tier**: Marginally Qualified
- **Key Strengths**: 
  * Strong relationship management and revenue generation background
  * Board-level understanding of nonprofit fundraising
  * Advanced degree and professional presentation skills
- **Notable Gaps**: 
  * No professional fundraising or grant writing experience
  * Lacks experience with donor databases and planned giving
  * Limited experience with nonprofit-specific compliance requirements

### Recommendation
While James brings valuable transferable skills from his sales career and demonstrates commitment through his board service, the lack of professional fundraising experience presents a significant gap for a Director-level position. Recommend considering for a lower-level development position or requesting additional information about fundraising responsibilities and achievements.
