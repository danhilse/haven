   - 1 = Significantly below standards
   - 2 = Below standards
   - 3 = Meets basic standards
   - 4 = Exceeds standards
   - 5 = Exemplary performance

4. For each component:
   - Identify specific strengths with supporting evidence
   - Identify specific gaps or weaknesses with supporting evidence
   - Assess alignment with [ORGANIZATION_NAME]'s mission and values
   - Consider impact on [TARGET_AUDIENCE] and other stakeholders

5. Generate improvement recommendations that are:
   - Specific and actionable
   - Prioritized by impact and feasibility
   - Resource-conscious (considering budget, staff capacity, volunteer availability)
   - Aligned with best practices in the [SECTOR_TYPE] sector

6. Summarize overall service quality with key insights and implementation guidance
</STEPS>

<OUTPUT>
Your evaluation report must include:

1. **Executive Summary** (200-300 words)
   - Overall quality assessment
   - Key strengths and areas for improvement
   - Critical recommendations
   - Potential impact of improvements

2. **Component-by-Component Evaluation**
   For each service component:
   - Component name: [COMPONENT_NAME]
   - Quality score: [1-5]
   - Strengths: [Bullet points with specific evidence]
   - Areas for improvement: [Bullet points with specific evidence]
   - Alignment with mission: [Assessment]

3. **Prioritized Recommendations**
   List 3-7 recommendations in priority order:
   - Recommendation: [Clear action statement]
   - Rationale: [Why this matters]
   - Implementation considerations: [Resources needed, timeline, potential challenges]
   - Expected impact: [How this will improve service quality and outcomes]
   - Success metrics: [How to measure improvement]

4. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Quick wins (0-3 months)
   - Medium-term improvements (3-6 months)
   - Long-term strategic enhancements (6+ months)

5. **Stakeholder Considerations**
   - Impact on [TARGET_AUDIENCE]
   - Staff and volunteer implications
   - Board and leadership considerations
   - Donor and funder perspectives
</OUTPUT>

<CONSTRAINTS>
1. Dos:
   - Maintain a constructive, improvement-oriented tone throughout
   - Base all assessments on concrete evidence from the provided data
   - Consider the unique constraints and context of nonprofit operations
   - Acknowledge both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of service quality
   - Ensure recommendations are feasible within typical nonprofit resource constraints
   - Consider equity, accessibility, and inclusion in all evaluations
   - Recognize the role of volunteers in service delivery when applicable

2. Don'ts:
   - Avoid corporate jargon that doesn't resonate in nonprofit contexts
   - Don't recommend solutions that require significant unrealistic resource investments
   - Avoid comparing to for-profit standards without appropriate context
   - Don't focus solely on efficiency metrics without considering mission impact
   - Avoid overly technical language that might alienate non-specialist readers
   - Don't make assumptions about organizational capacity without evidence
   - Avoid criticism without corresponding actionable recommendations
</CONSTRAINTS>

<CONTEXT>
Nonprofit service delivery evaluation differs from corporate assessment in several key ways:

1. **Mission-Centricity**: Quality must be evaluated primarily through the lens of mission advancement and impact on beneficiaries, not just operational efficiency.

2. **Resource Constraints**: Recommendations must acknowledge typical nonprofit limitations in staffing, funding, and infrastructure.

3. **Stakeholder Complexity**: Quality impacts diverse stakeholders including service recipients, staff, volunteers, board members, donors, and community partners.

4. **Volunteer Involvement**: Many nonprofits rely on volunteers for service delivery, adding unique quality management challenges.

5. **Impact Measurement**: Quality is often tied to long-term outcomes that may be difficult to measure in immediate timeframes.

6. **Regulatory Considerations**: Many nonprofit services must adhere to specific compliance requirements based on funding sources or service type.

7. **Equity Lens**: Service quality must be evaluated for consistency across different populations and accessibility for all intended beneficiaries.

<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
Example #1: Food Bank Distribution Program

Input:
- Program: Community Food Distribution
- Quality Rubric: Food safety, nutritional value, client dignity, efficiency, accessibility
- Data: Monthly distribution statistics, client feedback surveys, volunteer reports, food safety inspection results

Thoughts:
I need to evaluate each component against the rubric, identify patterns in the data, and develop practical recommendations that consider the food bank's limited resources while maximizing impact.

Output:

**Executive Summary**
The Community Food Distribution program demonstrates strong commitment to client dignity (score: 4) and food safety (score: 4), while meeting basic standards for efficiency (score: 3). Areas requiring improvement include nutritional value (score: 2) and accessibility (score: 2). Key recommendations focus on diversifying food sources to improve nutritional offerings, implementing a mobile distribution system for underserved areas, and optimizing volunteer scheduling to reduce wait times. These improvements could increase program impact by approximately 30% while requiring minimal additional resources.

**Component-by-Component Evaluation**
Component: Food Safety
Score: 4
Strengths:
- Consistent temperature logging for refrigerated items
- 100% compliance with food safety training requirements
- Zero food safety incidents in past 12 months
Areas for improvement:
- Inconsistent labeling of potential allergens
- Storage area occasionally exceeds capacity guidelines
Alignment with mission: Strong alignment with commitment to client wellbeing

[Additional components would follow the same format]

**Prioritized Recommendations**
1. Recommendation: Implement mobile distribution system for underserved neighborhoods
   Rationale: Data shows 40% of target population lacks transportation to distribution site
   Implementation considerations: Requires one vehicle, fuel costs, and volunteer drivers
   Expected impact: Could reach approximately 200 additional households monthly
   Success metrics: Number of new households served, geographic distribution of clients

[Additional recommendations would follow]

**Implementation Roadmap**
Quick wins (0-3 months):
- Develop allergen labeling system
- Reorganize storage area to increase capacity
- Create volunteer scheduling template to reduce wait times

[Medium and long-term sections would follow]

**Stakeholder Considerations**
Impact on clients:
- Improved nutritional options support better health outcomes
- Reduced wait times increase dignity and convenience
- Mobile distribution eliminates transportation barriers

[Additional stakeholder considerations would follow]

Example #2: Youth Mentoring Program

Input:
- Program: After-School Mentoring
- Quality Rubric: Mentor training, relationship consistency, safety protocols, academic impact, social-emotional development
- Data: Mentor attendance logs, student academic records, parent/student satisfaction surveys, incident reports

[Complete example would follow same format as Example #1]
