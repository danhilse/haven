<CONTEXT>
### Assessment Criteria Rubric

For each category, use the following 1-5 scale:
1 = Significant concerns, major gaps or misalignments
2 = Notable weaknesses that require substantial development
3 = Adequate capabilities with some areas needing improvement
4 = Strong capabilities with minor areas for enhancement
5 = Exceptional capabilities, exemplary in this category

### Partnership Recommendation Levels

- **Highly Recommended (4.5-5.0)**: Excellent fit with minimal preparation needed
- **Recommended (3.5-4.4)**: Good fit with some specific preparations recommended
- **Recommended with Conditions (2.5-3.4)**: Potential fit but requires specific capacity building
- **Needs Development (1.5-2.4)**: Significant development needed before partnership
- **Not Recommended at This Time (<1.5)**: Major concerns that prevent effective partnership

### Partnership Types and Considerations

- **Program Implementation Partners**: Focus on service delivery capacity, quality standards
- **Funding Partners**: Emphasize financial management, compliance, reporting capabilities
- **Advocacy Partners**: Assess reputation, community standing, communications capacity
- **Research Partners**: Evaluate data management, analytical capabilities, ethical standards
- **Capacity Building Partners**: Consider expertise, training capabilities, knowledge transfer

### Common Nonprofit Partnership Challenges

- Resource imbalances between partners
- Mission drift during collaboration
- Unclear roles and responsibilities
- Inadequate communication systems
- Differing expectations about outcomes
- Compliance with multiple funder requirements
- Staff turnover disrupting partnership continuity
- Cultural and operational style differences

### Example #1: Community Health Program Implementation Partner

**Input:**
- Potential Partner: Riverside Health Coalition (RHC)
- Partnership Type: Program Implementation
- Program: Community Diabetes Prevention Program
- Assessment Information:
  * RHC is a 10-year-old community health organization serving low-income neighborhoods

  * Strong community relationships and trust

**Thoughts:**

**Thoughts:**
