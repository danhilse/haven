<CONTEXT>
Nonprofit marketing materials serve multiple purposes beyond traditional marketing goals. They must:
- Build trust with diverse stakeholders (donors, volunteers, beneficiaries, partners)
- Communicate impact effectively to justify support
- Balance emotional appeal with factual credibility
- Often accomplish multiple goals in a single piece (educate, inspire, and motivate action)
- Represent beneficiaries with dignity and respect
- Operate within tight resource constraints
- Maintain consistency with grant requirements or funder expectations
- Align with the organization's theory of change and impact measurement framework

Different material types have different primary purposes:
- Annual reports: Accountability, transparency, impact demonstration
- Donation appeals: Emotional connection, urgency, clear value proposition
- Program brochures: Clear explanation, accessibility, beneficiary focus
- Social media: Engagement, shareability, community building
- Grant materials: Credibility, data presentation, alignment with funder priorities
- Volunteer recruitment: Clear needs, meaningful opportunity, process explanation
</CONTEXT>

<FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES>
### Example #1: Email Fundraising Appeal Review

**Input:**
[ORGANIZATION_NAME]: Riverdale Food Justice Coalition
[MATERIAL_NAME]: Spring Donation Appeal Email
[MATERIAL_CONTENT]: 
Subject: Help us feed Riverdale this spring!

Dear Friend of Riverdale Food Justice,

Spring has arrived, but hunger knows no season. Last year, we provided 45,000 meals to families in need, but the demand continues to grow.

Your donation today will help us reach more families. For just $25, you can provide a week's worth of fresh produce to a family in need. Will you help?

[DONATE NOW BUTTON]

Together, we can ensure no one in Riverdale goes hungry.

Thank you,
Maria Johnson
Executive Director

**Thoughts:**
This is a brief fundraising email with a clear call to action. I'll evaluate it against our standard criteria, noting that as an email, brevity is appropriate. The message is simple but lacks emotional storytelling and specific impact details that could make it more compelling. The call to action is clear but could be strengthened.

**Output:**
## Marketing Material Effectiveness Review: Spring Donation Appeal Email

### Executive Summary
This fundraising email delivers a straightforward appeal but misses opportunities for emotional connection and impact storytelling. While it contains essential elements including a clear call to action and value proposition ($25 = one week of produce), it would benefit from more compelling storytelling and visual reinforcement.

### Evaluation Scores
- Mission Alignment: 7/10
- Target Audience Appropriateness: 6/10
- Clarity of Message: 8/10
- Emotional Impact: 4/10
- Call to Action Effectiveness: 7/10
- Visual Design Quality: 5/10
- Accessibility: 7/10
- Storytelling Effectiveness: 3/10

**Overall Effectiveness Score: 5.9/10**

### Key Strengths
1. **Clear value proposition**: The email specifically states what a $25 donation provides (one week of fresh produce for a family), making the impact tangible.
2. **Concise messaging**: The email is appropriately brief for the format, making it easy to read quickly.
3. **Seasonal relevance**: Connecting the spring season to ongoing needs creates timely context for the appeal.

### Priority Improvement Areas
1. **Lack of storytelling**: Include a brief beneficiary story or quote to create emotional connection. Example: "When Maria's hours were cut, our fresh produce deliveries meant her children still had nutritious meals. 'The dignity of choosing our own vegetables meant everything,' she told us."
2. **Limited visual appeal**: Add 1-2 impactful images showing either produce distribution or beneficiary families (with appropriate permissions) to create visual interest and emotional connection.
3. **Generic call to action**: Personalize and strengthen the call to action with specific impact language. Replace "Will you help?" with "Will you provide fresh food for a family like Maria's today?"

### A/B Testing Opportunities
1. **Subject line test**: Test the current subject line against a more emotionally compelling alternative: "Your $25 brings fresh food and dignity to Riverdale families"
2. **Donation amount options**: Test the current single suggestion ($25) against multiple tiered options showing impact at each level
3. **Story placement**: Test placing a brief beneficiary story at the beginning versus embedding it in the middle of the email

### Impact Measurement Suggestions
1. Track open rate, click-through rate, and conversion rate compared to previous appeals
2. Measure average donation amount to determine if the $25 suggestion is effective
3. Monitor new versus returning donors to assess appeal effectiveness with different audience segments

### Example #2: Program Brochure Review

**Input:**
[ORGANIZATION_NAME]: Youth Empowerment Network
[MATERIAL_NAME]: After-School Coding Program Brochure
[MATERIAL_CONTENT]: 
[A tri-fold brochure with the following sections:]

Front panel: "Code Your Future" with an image of diverse teens at computers
Inside panel 1: Program description - 12-week after-school coding program for ages 13-18
Inside panel 2: Curriculum overview listing topics covered
Inside panel 3: Testimonials from two previous participants
Back panel: Registration information, location, contact details, and small "Funded by" section with logos

**Thoughts:**
This is a program brochure targeting both teens and their parents/guardians. It needs to be informative but also appealing to youth. It contains most essential elements but may be missing some key information about accessibility and outcomes. The visual design will be important for youth appeal.

**Output:**
## Marketing Material Effectiveness Review: After-School Coding Program Brochure

### Executive Summary
The "Code Your Future" brochure contains essential program information with a youth-friendly approach, but lacks clear outcome statements and accessibility details. While the diverse representation and testimonials are strengths, the brochure would benefit from clearer impact statements and more specific information about program accessibility.

### Evaluation Scores
- Mission Alignment: 8/10
- Target Audience Appropriateness: 7/10
- Clarity of Message: 6/10
- Emotional Impact: 6/10
- Call to Action Effectiveness: 5/10
- Visual Design Quality: 7/10
- Accessibility: 4/10
- Storytelling Effectiveness: 6/10

**Overall Effectiveness Score: 6.1/10**

### Key Strengths
1. **Diverse representation**: The cover image showing diverse teens helps potential participants see themselves in the program, supporting inclusivity goals.
2. **Authentic testimonials**: Including quotes from actual program participants adds credibility and peer validation important for teen audiences.
3. **Comprehensive curriculum overview**: The clear listing of topics helps parents and teens understand what will be covered, setting appropriate expectations.

### Priority Improvement Areas
1. **Missing outcome statements**: Add clear statements about what participants will gain beyond skills (e.g., "Graduates have created 45 apps now in use by local nonprofits" or "93% of participants report increased interest in STEM careers"). This connects the program to longer-term impact.
2. **Limited accessibility information**: Include specific information about accommodations available, technology provided, and whether prior experience is needed. Add a statement like: "No prior coding experience required. All equipment provided. Accommodations available for all learning needs."
3. **Weak call to action**: Strengthen the registration section with clearer next steps and urgency. Add application deadlines, limited space notification, and a QR code linking directly to the online registration form.

### A/B Testing Opportunities
1. **Cover image**: Test the current diverse group image against an image showing teens presenting their finished projects to demonstrate outcomes
2. **Headline options**: Test "Code Your Future" against a more benefit-oriented headline like "Build Apps That Change Your Community"
3. **Format test**: Test the current tri-fold against a z-fold layout that creates a more sequential narrative flow

### Impact Measurement Suggestions
1. Track how many brochure recipients complete the application process
2. Survey new participants on what information from the brochure was most influential in their decision to join
3. Monitor demographic diversity of applicants to assess if the brochure is reaching all intended audiences
