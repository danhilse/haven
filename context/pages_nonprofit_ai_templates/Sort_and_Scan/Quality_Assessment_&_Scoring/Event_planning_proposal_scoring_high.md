</CONSTRAINTS>

<CONTEXT>
Event proposals for nonprofits typically need to balance multiple considerations:

1. **Mission Advancement**: How the event will further the organization's core mission and strategic goals
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Appropriate use of limited staff time, volunteer capacity, and financial resources
3. **Audience Engagement**: Ability to meaningfully connect with target audiences (beneficiaries, donors, community members)
4. **Fundraising Potential**: Expected ROI if the event has a fundraising component
5. **Practical Feasibility**: Realistic timelines, staffing plans, and logistical considerations
6. **Risk Management**: Identification and mitigation of potential challenges
7. **Inclusivity and Accessibility**: Ensuring the event is accessible to diverse participants
8. **Measurement Plan**: Clear metrics for evaluating the event's success
9. **Marketing Strategy**: Approach for promoting the event to target audiences
10. **Follow-up Plan**: Strategy for maintaining engagement after the event

Common event types for nonprofits include:
- Fundraising galas/auctions
- Community awareness events
- Educational workshops/conferences
- Volunteer recognition events
- Donor appreciation events
- Advocacy/campaign launches
- Service delivery events
- Annual meetings/celebrations

Evaluation criteria should be adapted based on the specific event type and organizational priorities.

### Example #1: Community Health Fair Proposal Evaluation

**Input:**
Proposal Title: "Westside Community Health Fair"
Organization: Community Health Alliance
Event Type: Community Health Education Event
Evaluation Criteria:
1. Mission Alignment (25%) - How well does the event support our mission of improving health outcomes?
2. Community Impact (20%) - Expected reach and benefit to target populations
3. Resource Feasibility (20%) - Budget reasonableness and staff/volunteer requirements
4. Implementation Plan (15%) - Clarity and completeness of execution strategy
5. Partnerships (10%) - Quality of proposed community partnerships
6. Evaluation Method (10%) - Plan for measuring success

Proposal Summary: A one-day health fair at Westside Park featuring free health screenings, educational workshops, and resource booths from 15 partner organizations. Budget request of $7,500 with expected attendance of 500 community members. Staffing plan includes 5 staff members and 25 volunteers.

**Thoughts:**
- Strong mission alignment with specific health education components
- Good community impact with reasonable attendance projections
- Budget seems appropriate for scale, but volunteer coordination needs more detail
- Implementation timeline is clear but missing some logistical details
- Strong partnerships identified but commitment letters not included
- Basic evaluation metrics included but could be more comprehensive

**Output:**
# Community Health Education Event Proposal Evaluation: "Westside Community Health Fair"
**Evaluated for:** Community Health Alliance
**Date of Evaluation:** May 15, 2023
**Evaluator:** AI Evaluation Assistant

## Scoring Summary
| Criterion | Weight | Score (1-5) | Weighted Score |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Mission Alignment | 25% | 5 | 1.25 |
| Community Impact | 20% | 4 | 0.80 |
| Resource Feasibility | 20% | 3 | 0.60 |
| Implementation Plan | 15% | 4 | 0.60 |
| Partnerships | 10% | 4 | 0.40 |
| Evaluation Method | 10% | 3 | 0.30 |
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | | **3.95/5.00** |

## Detailed Assessment

### Mission Alignment: 5/5
**Justification:** The proposal directly addresses our core mission of improving health outcomes through education and access. The inclusion of free health screenings and targeted workshops on diabetes prevention and maternal health aligns perfectly with our strategic priorities for 2023.

### Community Impact: 4/5
**Justification:** The projected attendance of 500 participants from our target neighborhoods is realistic and significant. The proposal includes specific outreach strategies for reaching underserved populations, though it could better quantify expected health outcomes.

### Resource Feasibility: 3/5
**Justification:** The $7,500 budget is appropriate for an event of this scale, with reasonable allocations across categories. However, the staffing plan lacks detail on volunteer recruitment, training, and management, which presents a potential risk given the heavy reliance on volunteer support.

[Continued assessments for other criteria...]

## Key Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Health Services**: The proposal includes a diverse range of health screenings and educational workshops that directly address our community's most pressing health needs, particularly for low-income families.
2. **Strong Partner Engagement**: The inclusion of 15 partner organizations demonstrates excellent community buy-in and will significantly extend our reach and resource availability.
3. **Accessibility Considerations**: The proposal includes specific accommodations for language barriers, physical disabilities, and transportation challenges, ensuring broad community access.

## Areas for Improvement
1. **Volunteer Management**: Develop a more detailed volunteer recruitment and training plan, including specific roles, shift schedules, and training sessions. Consider designating a volunteer coordinator.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Strengthen the evaluation plan by including specific health outcome metrics and a follow-up strategy to measure longer-term impact beyond attendance numbers.
3. **Weather Contingency**: Develop a more robust backup plan for inclement weather, including potential indoor venue alternatives or rescheduling protocols.

## Mission Alignment
The Westside Community Health Fair proposal exemplifies our mission to improve community health outcomes through education and access. The focus on preventive screenings and education in our highest-need neighborhoods directly supports our strategic goal of reducing preventable health conditions. The proposal's emphasis on creating a welcoming, stigma-free environment aligns with our organizational values of dignity and accessibility.

## Resource Feasibility
The proposed budget of $7,500 is reasonable for the expected impact. Cost-saving measures, including donated supplies from healthcare partners, demonstrate good stewardship. The staffing model relies heavily on volunteers (5:1 volunteer-to-staff ratio), which is feasible but requires more detailed coordination planning. The 6-month timeline provides adequate preparation time, though some milestones could be more clearly defined.

## Risk Assessment
The proposal does not adequately address potential challenges with partner reliability and commitment. Written confirmation from all 15 partners should be secured before proceeding. Additionally, the marketing timeline appears compressed, with promotional materials scheduled for development just one month before the event, creating potential timing risks.

## Final Recommendation
**Recommendation Category:** Recommend with Minor Revisions
**Rationale:** This proposal strongly supports our mission with a well-designed event that will benefit our target community. With modest improvements to the volunteer management plan, evaluation metrics, and risk mitigation strategies, this has excellent potential for success.

## Next Steps
- Request a more detailed volunteer management plan within 2 weeks
- Suggest strengthening the evaluation framework with 2-3 specific health outcome metrics
- Recommend securing written commitments from all partner organizations
- Advise developing a more detailed weather contingency plan
- Suggest moving up the marketing materials development by at least 2 weeks

### Example #2: Annual Fundraising Gala Proposal Evaluation

**Input:**
Proposal Title: "Under the Stars: 10th Anniversary Gala"
Organization: Youth Mentorship Foundation
Event Type: Fundraising Gala
Evaluation Criteria:
1. Fundraising Potential (30%) - Projected net revenue and donor engagement
2. Mission Showcase (20%) - How effectively the event highlights our impact
3. Budget Efficiency (20%) - Cost-effectiveness and expense justification
4. Logistics & Planning (15%) - Thoroughness of implementation plan
5. Marketing Strategy (15%) - Approach for attracting attendees and sponsors

Proposal Summary: An evening gala at the Metropolitan Hotel featuring a silent auction, youth performances, and testimonials. Budget of $45,000 with projected revenue of $120,000 ($75,000 net). Expected attendance of 200 guests including major donors and corporate sponsors. Theme celebrates 10 years of youth mentorship impact.

**Thoughts:**
- Strong fundraising potential with realistic projections based on past events
- Excellent mission showcase with youth involvement and impact stories
- Budget efficiency concerns with high venue and catering costs
- Detailed logistics plan but timeline appears compressed
- Marketing strategy lacks digital component and clear sponsor acquisition plan

**Output:**
# Fundraising Gala Proposal Evaluation: "Under the Stars: 10th Anniversary Gala"
**Evaluated for:** Youth Mentorship Foundation
**Date of Evaluation:** May 15, 2023
**Evaluator:** AI Evaluation Assistant

| **TOTAL** | **100%** | | **3.80/5.00** |

[Detailed assessment continues with similar format to Example #1...]

## Final Recommendation
