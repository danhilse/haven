**Example #1: Youth Mentorship Program Proposal**

**Input:**
- Proposal: "Building Futures Youth Mentorship Program" - aims to connect at-risk youth with professional mentors
- Evaluation Criteria: Program Need (1-5), Implementation Plan (1-5), Budget Feasibility (1-5), Expected Outcomes (1-5), Evaluation Plan (1-5)
- Organization Context: Education-focused nonprofit with limited budget but strong community partnerships

**Thoughts:**
The proposal clearly identifies the community need with statistics but lacks detail in the implementation timeline. The budget is reasonable but doesn't account for mentor training costs. Outcome measures are well-defined, but the evaluation plan lacks specific data collection methods.

**Output:**

**Executive Summary**
This proposal for the Building Futures Youth Mentorship Program demonstrates a strong understanding of community needs and includes well-defined outcome measures. With a total score of 18/25 (72%), I recommend REVISING the proposal before approval. Key strengths include the needs assessment and outcome definition, while the implementation timeline and evaluation methodology require significant development.

**Detailed Scoring**
| Criterion | Score | Max Score | Percentage |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Program Need | 5 | 5 | 100% |
| Implementation Plan | 3 | 5 | 60% |
| Budget Feasibility | 3 | 5 | 60% |
| Expected Outcomes | 4 | 5 | 80% |
| Evaluation Plan | 3 | 5 | 60% |
| **TOTAL** | **18** | **25** | **72%** |

**Criterion-by-Criterion Analysis**

*Program Need: 5/5*
The proposal excellently documents the need with current statistics showing 35% of local youth lack adult mentorship. It cites three recent community studies and includes testimonials from school counselors, demonstrating a clear gap in services.

*Implementation Plan: 3/5*
While the proposal outlines the major program components, it lacks a detailed timeline for implementation. The mentor recruitment strategy is strong, but the proposal doesn't specify how mentors and youth will be matched or how often they will meet.

*Budget Feasibility: 3/5*
The $45,000 budget is reasonable for program scope, but doesn't include costs for mentor training or background checks. The proposal leverages existing partnerships effectively but should clarify in-kind contributions.

*Expected Outcomes: 4/5*
The proposal clearly defines expected outcomes including improved school attendance, academic performance, and reduced risk behaviors. It would be strengthened by including specific, measurable targets for each outcome.

*Evaluation Plan: 3/5*
The evaluation approach includes pre/post surveys, but lacks specific data collection methods and timeline. The proposal should clarify who will conduct the evaluation and how results will inform program improvements.

**Key Recommendations**
1. **Develop a detailed implementation timeline** with specific milestones for program launch, recruitment, training, and ongoing activities. Include staff responsibilities for each phase.

2. **Revise the budget to include mentor training costs** and background checks. Consider adding a 10% contingency line item to account for unexpected expenses during the pilot phase.

3. **Strengthen the evaluation plan** by specifying data collection methods, frequency, and responsible parties. Include both quantitative metrics (attendance rates, grades) and qualitative assessment (participant satisfaction).

4. **Add specific, measurable targets** for each expected outcome (e.g., "85% of participants will improve school attendance by at least 15%").

**Next Steps**
- Submit revised proposal within 3 weeks
- Program staff are available for a consultation meeting to discuss recommendations
- Review the "Effective Youth Program Evaluation" guide in our resource library
- Consider partnering with the local university for evaluation support

**Example #2: Community Garden Grant Proposal**

**Input:**
- Proposal: "Green Spaces Community Garden Initiative" - aims to create accessible garden spaces in food desert neighborhoods
- Evaluation Criteria: Community Impact (1-10), Sustainability Plan (1-10), Community Engagement (1-10), Budget (1-10)
- Organization Context: Environmental nonprofit with strong volunteer base but limited funding

**Thoughts:**
The proposal presents a compelling community impact case with specific locations identified. The sustainability plan relies heavily on volunteer labor without addressing potential turnover. Community engagement strategies are innovative but budget lacks detail on ongoing maintenance costs.

**Output:**

**Executive Summary**
The Green Spaces Community Garden Initiative proposal presents an innovative approach to addressing food insecurity through community-led gardens. With a score of 31/40 (78%), I recommend APPROVAL WITH REVISIONS. The proposal excels in community impact and engagement strategies but requires strengthening in the sustainability plan and budget details before final approval.

**Detailed Scoring**
| Criterion | Score | Max Score | Percentage |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Community Impact | 9 | 10 | 90% |
| Sustainability Plan | 6 | 10 | 60% |
| Community Engagement | 8 | 10 | 80% |
| Budget | 8 | 10 | 80% |
| **TOTAL** | **31** | **40** | **78%** |

**Criterion-by-Criterion Analysis**

*Community Impact: 9/10*
The proposal excellently identifies three specific food desert neighborhoods with compelling statistics on food insecurity (37% of residents). The projected impact of providing fresh produce to 150+ families is well-supported by similar projects. The proposal could be strengthened by including potential health outcomes.

*Sustainability Plan: 6/10*
While the proposal includes a three-year maintenance plan, it relies heavily on volunteer labor without addressing potential turnover. The water conservation system is innovative, but the plan lacks contingencies for seasonal challenges and long-term leadership transition.

*Community Engagement: 8/10*
The proposal demonstrates strong community engagement through 3 planning sessions with 45+ residents and partnerships with 2 neighborhood associations. The proposed governance structure involving resident leadership is promising, though it could benefit from more specific onboarding processes for new community leaders.

*Budget: 8/10*
The $12,500 budget is appropriate for initial implementation with clear allocation for materials, soil, and tools. However, the ongoing maintenance budget lacks detail, particularly regarding replacement tools and soil amendments. The in-kind donations are well-documented.

**Key Recommendations**
1. **Strengthen the sustainability plan** by developing a volunteer recruitment and retention strategy, including regular training sessions and leadership development for community members.

2. **Enhance the budget section** with a more detailed 3-year maintenance budget that includes seasonal costs, replacement tools, and soil amendments. Consider creating a small reserve fund for unexpected repairs.

3. **Develop a weather contingency plan** that addresses potential challenges like drought or flooding, including water conservation strategies and garden bed protection methods.

4. **Add specific health outcome metrics** to the community impact section, such as increased vegetable consumption among participating families or improved food security scores.

**Next Steps**
- Submit revised proposal within 2 weeks
- Schedule site visits to proposed garden locations with evaluation committee
- Connect with our volunteer coordinator to discuss recruitment strategies
- Review successful community garden models in our resource database
