**Complexity:** Low

## Template

```
Act as an email triage assistant for [ORGANIZATION_NAME] and help me prioritize our inbox by analyzing these emails I'll paste. Categorize each email as Urgent (requires same-day response), Important (respond within 48 hours), or Routine (respond when convenient), then sort them by priority and suggest a brief response approach for each. Consider our mission of [MISSION_STATEMENT] and prioritize donor communications, program inquiries, and time-sensitive opportunities.
