This program requires sensitive communications with clear crisis resources.

   - Session Reminders: 48 hours and 2 hours before each weekly session
   - Missed Session Follow-up: Within 24 hours of missed session
   - Monthly Progress Check-in: First Monday of each month
   - 3-Month Outcome Assessment: 90 days after program start
   - Re-engagement: After 2 consecutive missed sessions
