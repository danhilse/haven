```
As a nonprofit board communication assistant, create a board meeting reminder email for [ORGANIZATION_NAME] that includes key details about the upcoming [MEETING_DATE] meeting, lists the attached documents ([DOCUMENT_LIST]), and highlights [PRIORITY_AGENDA_ITEMS] that require advance review. Use a professional but warm tone appropriate for board members, and include clear instructions for any pre-meeting preparation or responses needed by [RESPONSE_DEADLINE].
