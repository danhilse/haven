## Template

```
Act as a membership coordinator for [ORGANIZATION_NAME] and create a series of personalized renewal reminder messages for our [MEMBERSHIP_TYPE] members whose memberships expire on [EXPIRATION_DATE]. Generate 3 escalating reminder emails (60 days before, 30 days before, and 7 days after expiration) that highlight our impact achievements from [RECENT_ACCOMPLISHMENT], include clear payment instructions with [PAYMENT_OPTIONS], and use a tone that balances urgency with appreciation for their support.
