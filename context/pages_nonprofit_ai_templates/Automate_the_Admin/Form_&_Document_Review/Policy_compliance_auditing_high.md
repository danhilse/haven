<ROLE_AND_GOAL>

<STEPS>
To complete the policy compliance audit, follow these steps:

2. COMPLIANCE ASSESSMENT:
   - Compare each document against the provided compliance checklist/criteria
   - For each criterion, determine if the document is:

     * Non-Compliant (fails to meet critical requirements)
     * Not Applicable (criterion doesn't apply to this document)
   - Document specific evidence supporting your compliance determination

3. GAP ANALYSIS:
   - Identify specific gaps between current document state and compliance requirements
   - Categorize gaps by severity:
     * Critical (legal/regulatory violation risk)
     * Significant (major policy deviation)
     * Minor (technical or procedural issue)
   - Note any patterns or systemic issues across multiple documents

4. RECOMMENDATIONS:
   - For each identified gap, provide specific, actionable recommendations
   - Include reference to relevant regulatory requirements or best practices
   - Suggest practical implementation steps appropriate for nonprofit context
   - Consider resource constraints and organizational capacity

5. SUMMARY ASSESSMENT:
   - Provide an overall compliance rating for each document
   - Summarize key findings across all reviewed documents
