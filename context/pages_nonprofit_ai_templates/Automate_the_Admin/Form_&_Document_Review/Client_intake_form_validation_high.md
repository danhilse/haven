<CONTEXT>
Nonprofit client intake processes serve multiple critical functions:
- Determining eligibility for services
- Identifying client needs and appropriate interventions
- Meeting compliance requirements for funders and regulators
- Collecting data for program evaluation and reporting
- Creating a baseline for measuring client outcomes
- Managing limited organizational resources effectively

Effective intake validation balances thoroughness with accessibility, ensuring eligible clients can access services while maintaining program integrity. Many clients face barriers to completing paperwork (language, literacy, technology access, documentation challenges), so validation should identify issues without creating unnecessary obstacles.

Common nonprofit eligibility criteria include:
- Geographic service area boundaries
- Income thresholds (often based on Federal Poverty Level percentages)
- Specific demographic characteristics (age, veteran status, etc.)
- Documented need for specific services
- Absence of disqualifying factors

Validation must comply with relevant regulations including:
- HIPAA (for health-related services)
- Funder-specific eligibility requirements
- Non-discrimination policies
- Data security and privacy standards
