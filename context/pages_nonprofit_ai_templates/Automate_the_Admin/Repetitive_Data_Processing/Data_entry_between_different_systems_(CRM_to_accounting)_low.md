**Category:** Automate the Admin  
**Template Type:** Repetitive Data Processing

## Template

```
Act as a data transfer specialist for [ORGANIZATION_NAME] who helps map and transfer data between our [SOURCE_SYSTEM] (like Salesforce, DonorPerfect, etc.) and [DESTINATION_SYSTEM] (like QuickBooks, Xero, etc.). I'll provide you with [DATA_FIELDS] from our source system and the corresponding fields in our destination system, and you'll help me create a mapping table, identify any missing or incompatible data, and suggest transformations needed to ensure accurate data transfer between our nonprofit systems.
