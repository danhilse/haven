# Copy Guide for Nonprofit Prompt App

The trap here is to market a “prompt library” (tool-centric, inward) versus marketing a “guidance engine” (outcome-centric, outward). Nonprofits aren’t browsing prompts; they’re hunting for answers to live problems. So the copy should abstract away “AI prompts” and talk instead about clarity, relief, and acceleration—calm, serene tone; slightly esoteric metaphors are fine as long as the results are nailed down.

## Voice & Tone

*   **Calm, supportive, steady:** Never breathless or “disruptive.”
*   **Slightly esoteric:** Gentle metaphors (“a compass in crowded waters”) to elevate mood.
*   **Practical, direct:** Always pivot back to tangible outcomes: “a grant draft in minutes,” “donor letters that feel human,” etc.
*   **Avoid jargon:** Don’t say “prompt,” say “ready-made guidance,” “conversation starter,” or “templates tuned to your mission.”
*   **Agency of the user:** They’re the hero, the tool is the ally.

---

## Positioning

*   **Not:** “AI-powered prompt library.”
*   **Is:** “Instant guidance for the work nonprofits do every day.”

### Value Propositions

*   **Save time:** “Hours of writing distilled to a few clicks.”
*   **Unlock clarity:** “Answers and drafts that cut through overwhelm.”
*   **Consistency:** “Your voice, everywhere—clear and aligned.”
*   **Access:** “Expert-level help without needing an expert on staff.”

---

## Naming Conventions

*   **Refer to system as:** “guide,” “library of answers,” “ready-to-use support.”
*   **Refer to prompts as:** “templates,” “conversations,” “paths.”
*   **Avoid:** “prompt,” “AI model,” “embeddings,” “tech stack.”

## Copy Structures

### Landing Headline

*   “Answers at your fingertips, for every part of your mission.”
*   “The quiet helper behind your busy days.”
*   “Turn big tasks into simple steps.”

### Subhead / Value Framing

*   “Whether it’s a donor thank-you, a grant draft, or a policy update, we help you start strong and finish faster.”

### Benefit Bullets

*   Consistent communication across staff & channels
*   Rapid first drafts that save hours
*   Donor, board, and volunteer messages that feel personal
*   Research & reporting shortcuts that clarify decisions

### Example Framing

*   **Instead of:** “We have a prompt for donor thank-you letters”
*   **Say:** “Never stare at a blank screen when thanking a donor again.”

### CTAs

*   “Try it on your next project”
*   “Find your next answer”
*   “Explore the library”

---

## Writing Rules

*   Keep sentences short, uncluttered.
*   1 metaphor per section max (avoid purple haze).
*   Always end a section by pivoting to a concrete nonprofit pain point.
*   Use 2nd person (“you,” “your team”).
*   Never explain how it works (prompts, GPT-5) → focus on what it delivers.
